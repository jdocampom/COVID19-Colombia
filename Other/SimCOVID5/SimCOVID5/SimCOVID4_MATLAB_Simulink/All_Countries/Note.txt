Note: The major difference between the programs is in the sigmoid function used for the beta variable. 
Update 1 and 2 use three step functions for the sigmoid (faster). 
Update 3 uses five step functions for the sigmoid. 
Update 4 uses ten step functions for the sigmoid. 
Update 5 uses 20 step functions for the sigmoid. 
Update 6 is a generalized method that determines the number of sigmoid functions needed for each outbreak by itself (smoother).
